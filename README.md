# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

We've been given a collection of .csv files to figure out the number of employees that will soon be retiring. By determining this number beforehand, the company will be able to plan ahead and hire the needed amount of people so they would not have to experience any setbacks due to being understaffed.

Results: 

  -Determine the full list of employees that will be retiring soon. (retirement_info.csv)
  -Determine the number of employees who will be retiring in each department. (retiring_titles.csv)
  -Determine each soon-to-be retiring employee's current position to plan ahead on future hires. (titles.csv)
  -Determine who would be eligible to be a mentor in the mentorship program to have them help train new hires. (mentorship_eligibility.csv)

Summary:

There will be 90,398 positions that will need to be filled after employees that qualify retire. This is assuming that no one would be interested in being the company mentorship program, which will unlikely be true. However, we need to keep in mind that this analysis is only for the current time, more and more employees will be close to retirement time as time goes on, so as a company, Pewlett-Hackard will need to continuously plan ahead to make sure to acquire the best talent. Other companies will also sought to plan ahead and hire ahead; therefore, the early we execute our plans, the better. If we can hire close to half of the number of employees that will be retiring before they retire, then the company will be in good shape to get them ready to take on difficult roles, like manager. Looking at the large number of employees that will be retiring by department, there should be enough to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. Being a large company means big shoes to fill, but that also mean there are more people and resources to keep operations going smoothly. There may be many that will retire, but there are also many that will stay.
